            <p>Kalyani is TCNJ's South-Asian Pop-Bollywood-Classical fusion singing group. But we also allow
                instrumentalists and beatdoxers. We welcome folks of ANY skill level, beginner to advanced!
                Plus, we offer multiple workshops for all three singing styles.</p>

            <p>This year, sometime in April, Kalyani became a Recognized Student Organization. Before this
                happened, Kalyani occassionally performs at small events at TCNJ and ISA. But as this
                organization progresses, we widen our audience to perform at TCNJ's Asian American Association
                and a few of its subsidiaries (Barkada for example).
