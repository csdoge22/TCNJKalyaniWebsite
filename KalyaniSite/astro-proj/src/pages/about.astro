        <p>Kalyani is TCNJ's South-Asian Pop-Bollywood-Classical fusion singing group. But we also allow
            instrumentalists and beatdoxers. We welcome folks of ANY skill level, beginner to advanced!
            Plus, we offer multiple workshops for all three singing styles.</p>

        <p>This year, sometime in April, Kalyani became a Recognized Student Organization. Before this
            happened, Kalyani occassionally performs at small events at TCNJ and ISA. But as this
            organization progresses, we widen our audience to perform at TCNJ's Asian American Association
            and a few of its subsidiaries (Barkada for example).
            
            Fun Fact: I joined this organization one year after it formed.</p>
