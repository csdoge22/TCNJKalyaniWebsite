This year, sometime in April, Kalyani became a Recognized Student Organization. Before this
happened, Kalyani occassionally performs at small events at TCNJ and ISA. But as this
organization progresses, we widen our audience to perform at TCNJ's Asian American Association
and a few of its subsidiaries (Barkada for example).

Fun Fact: I joined this organization one year after it formed.
